/// Log is a struct meant to be a central access point & extension for more logs.
///
/// Log can be extended to add central access to a variety of logs like so.
/// ```swift
/// extension Log {
/// 	static let myLogger = Logger(subsystem: "com.myapp.networking", category: "networking")
/// }
/// ```
struct Log {
	/// General Logger for anything to use as a starting point
	static let general = Logger(subsystem: "com.unittestkit.general", category: "general")
}

///   - function: The function the print message is used in. Obtained automatically.
///   - line: The line of the file the print message is used in. Obtained automatically.
